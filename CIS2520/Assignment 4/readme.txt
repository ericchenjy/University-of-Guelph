AVL tree:
-the program will first read a tree
-it will find a key
-insert a key to the tree, it the key is reepated, the counter will increase by one
-remove a key from the tree and will decrease the size of the frequency
-find the the height, the size, and the total count of the tree
-it will find the inorder keys of frequencies
-I initialize the height of my tree to 1

1. Initializaiton
2. Find
3. Insert
4. Remove
5. Check Height, Size and Total Count
6. Find ALL(Above a given frequency
7. Exit
